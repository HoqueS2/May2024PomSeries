Reporting: Extend Report
		  pom.xml ---> add dependencies --->  extentreports  <----
		  
src/main/java ---> create package: qa.com.opencart.listerners
			---> create class : ExtentReportListener.java
								----> method : you can uncomment if you don't want any screen shot for passed TC
								
		
  			---> create class: AnnotationTransformer.java for screenshot
  			--> create class: Retry.java for retry to the failed test case
  			
Listerners are come from testNG. Once you start executing TC Listerners will activated and keep start lisening to you TC then creat report.


ScreenShot : add one Listerners in the testng_regresion.xml file
		   : In DriverFactory.java create one method getScreenShot()
		   : Interface --> [(TakesScreenshot) getDriver()]  ---> converted your getDriver to TakesScreenshot interface
		    then change source file to path file. file to file exchange
		   : create one folder in project level --> screenShot folder
		    
		    
Report: Refresh the project ---> report folder --> right click --> properties --> copy path --> paste in browser 
Screen Shot: go to screenshot folder and click


Retry: ---> create class: AnnotationTransformer.java for screenshot
  	   --> create class: Retry.java for retry to the failed test case
  	   --> add listeners to testNG.xml
  	   
Note: Incase you want to run TC from test class then you won't get any report, screenshot and retry service.
Solution: on the test class level add liseners annotation look at LoginPageTest.java class 


Failure Test Cases: refresh the project --> test output folder --> testng_failed.xml --> you can run your failed tc from there

Soft Assert: in case if you want to use data provider and set your negative data first then positive data soft assert has some issue as we 
			create the soft assert object in base class. first its go to base class with negative data and status become false then when it get
			positive data it couldn't change the status so our positive tc got failed even with right data.
			
Solution: create the soft assert object in locally method level instead of BaseTest class level.
		ProductInfoPageTest.java ---> myData() data provider --> productInfoTest()
		Remove soft assert from Base class
