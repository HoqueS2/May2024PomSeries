Git :

create git branch --------> 
							git branch  // now poiting on master
							git branch demopage  // creating brunch from master 
							git branch    // check how many bruch you create still pointing to master
							git checkout demopage  // pointing to demopage brunch now 
							git brunch 
							
							
Go to your project click on (close project) then open it again.
Now next to your project you will see the branch name .
If you want to got to master then follow the same process ----> : git checkout master


Project -----> create one page called Demopage.java in my demopage brunch

Git:

		git status // check current status. You will see the untracked file. you have to add then commit the file
		git add (paste untracked file)   // will tracked the file
		git commit -m "Added DemoPage"   // will commit the file
		
		
Pushed the code on remote site: This time we will push it on demopage brunch which will by default created on remote site. we will not push in on master site


		git push origin demopage  // will create a demopage bruch on remote site.  * [new branch]      demopage -> demopage
		
		
Git account refesh you will see one demopage brunch is created and new code is reflected there. But in master no new code is reflected.
Because my remote master is lagging .

For Tags in the git (00:25:00)
From a specific tags I want to release a version
Tags —> create a Version 


Conflict: (00:36:00)
Create a class —> AppLogin.java
Same time other qa member create same class with same method—> 
* Go to remote site and create one file with other qa member name. And she already add, commit , push , pr, and marge the code in remote master
* My work is not complete yet and meanwhile I got notification that remote site got updated
* Now I have to take a latest pull form remote
* : git pull origin main —-> you got error cz from your local you have some untracked file 
* : git add file
* : git commit -m “added AppLogin page”
* So here I already save the file in local and stage
* Now I want to pull the latest remote master
* : git pull origin main
* Git Asking why you need to merge explain
* Press i (enabled insert mode) —> taking latest pull from remote
* Press escape——> insert mode is gone
* :wq!  —> to save the message
* Refresh the project then you will see latest pull successful because there is no conflict , both qa guys write the same code and method 
* 2nd scenerio —> bena code is different from my code
* Change code in remote site which bena is push
* Now from your site you do the latest pull and give the explanation
* Refresh the project —> you see bena code is updated. Conflict not happen cz class name and method name is still same
* 3rd scenerio
* In your local change your AppLogin page code add some new method 
* Add, commit, no push
* Bena also change code this time our code is not same  and merge to master
* Now you try to pull and git says “conflict
* In that scenario we don’t have any command to resolve the issue
* So me and bena need to communicate to solve the issue then manually we have to solve it 
* In local In the same file I have my code and bena code with some sign like ======== or  >>>>>>>>> or some number of bena code 
* After communicate we decide which code is right then we decide which code need to delete
* From my local I start update my code and remove all the conflict sign 
* Add, commit, push  now my code is in the remote site
* Now bena need to delete manually her code from her local
