Git :

create git branch --------> 
							git branch  // now poiting on master
							git branch demopage  // creating brunch from master 
							git branch    // check how many bruch you create still pointing to master
							git checkout demopage  // pointing to demopage brunch now 
							git brunch 
							
							
Go to your project click on (close project) then open it again.
Now next to your project you will see the branch name .
If you want to got to master then follow the same process ----> : git checkout master


Project -----> create one page called Demopage.java in my demopage brunch

Git:

		git status // check current status. You will see the untracked file. you have to add then commit the file
		git add (paste untracked file)   // will tracked the file
		git commit -m "Added DemoPage"   // will commit the file
		
		
Pushed the code on remote site: This time we will push it on demopage brunch which will by default created on remote site. we will not push in on master site


		git push origin demopage  // will create a demopage bruch on remote site.  * [new branch]      demopage -> demopage
		
		
Git account refesh you will see one demopage brunch is created and new code is reflected there. But in master no new code is reflected.
Because my remote master is lagging .

PR: now we have to raise a PR ----->
							go to pull request tab
							new pull request
							click on compare main: and select demopage  [ main  <---- demopage ]
							create pull request
							compleate form and select reviewer and click create pull request

				git add (paste untracked file)   // will tracked the file
				git commit -m "Fixed DemoPage issue"   // will commit the file
